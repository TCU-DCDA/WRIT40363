# Azure Deployment - DISCONTINUED

## Summary
After extensive troubleshooting, Azure App Service deployment was abandoned due to persistent issues:

### Issues Encountered:
- ✅ **Build Process**: GitHub Actions workflow built successfully
- ✅ **Deployment**: Files deployed to Azure without errors  
- ✅ **App Service**: HTTP 200 responses received
- ❌ **Content Serving**: App served empty responses (content-length: 0)
- ❌ **IIS/Node Integration**: Configuration issues with web.config
- ❌ **Platform Complexity**: Too many Azure-specific configurations required

### What We Tried:
1. Fixed multiple YAML syntax errors in GitHub Actions
2. Updated Node.js version from 18-lts to 20-lts
3. Created debugging server.js entry point
4. Updated web.config for IIS/Node integration
5. Added comprehensive deployment logging
6. Switched between simple server and full TypeScript app
7. Added iisnode.yml configuration
8. Multiple deployment attempts with different configurations

### Result:
- **Local App**: ✅ Works perfectly (confirmed with full UI)
- **Azure Deployment**: ❌ Empty responses despite successful builds
- **Time Invested**: ~3 hours of troubleshooting

## Decision: Switch to Vercel
Azure App Service adds unnecessary complexity for Node.js applications. Vercel is purpose-built for this use case.

*Azure workflow disabled in main_actualmusk.yml*
*All effort now focused on Vercel deployment*
