## Land Acknowledgment

As a university, we acknowledge the many benefits we have of being in
this place. It is a space we share with all living beings, human and
non-human. It is an ancient space where others have lived before us. The
monument created jointly by TCU and the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes
reminds us of our benefits, responsibilities, and relationships. We
pause to reflect on its words: *This ancient land, for all our
relations*. We respectfully acknowledge all Native American peoples who
have lived on this land since time immemorial. TCU especially
acknowledges and pays respect to the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes
(*Kitikiti\'sh/Kirikirish*), upon whose historical homeland our
university is located.

# Course Description

> **Catalog Description:** "Explores the complex relationship between
> new media, culture, and design, with particular emphasis on the
> production of mobile applications and eBooks publications. Course
> emphasizes concepts in rhetoric, multimedia, and authorship in digital
> environments. Students design and compose a variety of multimedia
> products incorporating print, image, and other modes. Student cannot
> receive credit for WRIT 55743 and WRIT 40363."

This section of WRIT 40363 will focus on the basics of web design to
develop web applications that support work in the humanities and social
sciences. To this end, students should come prepared to study HTML, CSS,
and JavaScript. Students will also learn the basics of database
development to provide relevant and timely content for the applications
they develop.

This is an introductory course, but it is designed for students
interested in computers and working thoughtfully and creatively in
digital environments.

[]{#_Toc197001300 .anchor}**Prerequisites & Concurrent Enrollment**

There are no prerequisites for this class.

[]{#_Toc197001301 .anchor}**Program and Major Connections**

- **Digital Culture and Data Analytics major/minor:** Required courses
  (selection)

- **Writing & Rhetoric major/minor:** Digital Rhetorics and Design
  (subcategory)

- **English major/minor:** Elective

# Required Textbook

There are no required textbooks for this class. All required readings
and resources will be available for free in D2L.

# Teaching Methodology

The first third of the course will focus on 1) learning the basics of
HTML, CSS, and JS and 2) a sequence of "labs" or minor assignments. The
rest of the class will focus on applying those web development skills to
web applications relevant to work in the Humanities and Social Sciences.
We will provide a blend of lectures, in-class programming
demonstrations, guided activities, and one-on-one support.

# Learning Outcomes 

Learning outcomes are the driving forces of this course: they are the
focusing themes that inform everything we do. The learning outcomes
listed below are the goals we are working toward that you should meet by
the end of WRIT 40363.

## Course Learning Outcomes 

These two outcomes, particular to this course, shape the work we'll do
this semester:

1.  Students will use their skill in web development as an exploratory
    research tool designed to address, but not always answer, important
    cultural questions.

2.  Students will reflect on the limitations of multimodal communication
    common to the Digital Humanities.

## Program and Major Learning Outcomes 

These outcomes are particular to the majors/minors in Digital Culture
and Data Analytics (DCDA); English; and Writing & Rhetoric:

3.  Students will demonstrate an ability to compose digital arguments
    \[DCDA0\]

4.  Students will analyze how rhetorical acts and texts in various media
    emerge from or respond to specific cultural discourses and/or
    relations of power. \[WRIT02\]

## TCU Outcomes: Core Curriculum

WRIT 40363 fulfills the Writing Emphasis (WEM) outcomes for the TCU
[Core
Curriculum](https://provost.tcu.edu/faculty-resources/core-curriculum/core-curriculum-students/)

SLO 2: Students will exhibit the ability to use writing as a means of
gaining and expressing an understanding of discipline-specific content.

# Course Assignments & Final Grade

## Assignments

Throughout the semester, the majority of your evaluated work will
consist of **six (6) Homework Assignments** and **three (3) Threaded
Discussions**. Some of these will engage with the reading done for
class, typically not just checking to see if you read, but asking you to
think further on a given topic, concept, or concern. Some of these will
be used as "scaffolding": building the skills necessary for the semester
project. Some will be technological: for example, developing or revising
simple computer scripts written in HTML, CSS, and/or JavaScript.

## Project

There will be one major assignment, a final **Semester Project** that
may be individual or group, that will allow you to practice and showcase
the skills you\'ve acquired in the class. 

## Grading Philosophy and Policy

In this class, **we won't be grading individual assignments or
calculating points/percentages**. Instead, we'll offer lots of feedback
without any points or letter associated with it---but along the way we
will indicate if you are meeting expectations. In addition to our
written feedback, we will indicate if your work on the assignment
**Exceeds**, **Meets**, or **Fails to Meet** Expectations. Throughout
the semester, you will write **three self-reflection essays** (about a
page each) on your development as a learner. On the second and third of
these essays, you will indicate the grade you believe you have earned to
date in the course. For Reflections 2 and 3, you will be asked to assess
yourself in terms of your growth in the following areas:

> **Coding Competency in HTML, CSS, and JS**
>
> **Audience Engagement, Accessibility, and User Experience (UX)**
>
> **Project Design and Planning**
>
> **Collaboration**

The grades you argue for your midterm and final semester grades should
be expressed as traditional letter grades (A, A-, B+, B, B- and so on).
We reserve the right to change your grade, but in general we defer to
you as the best judge of your learning.

For more information on the rationale behind this system, we recommend
these short, approachable blog posts by Dr. Jesse Stommel: \"[**[Why I
Don\'t
Grade]{.underline}**](https://www.jessestommel.com/why-i-dont-grade/)\"
and \"[**[How to
Ungrade]{.underline}**](https://www.jessestommel.com/how-to-ungrade/).\" We
are more than willing to supply more detailed pedagogical scholarship on
this rationale at your request. The online self-reflection essay
documents provide detailed descriptions of how to successfully argue for
a grade. 

For your reference, the [faculty definition of
grades](https://undergraduate.catalog.tcu.edu/policies/academic/list#grading),
and the letter/percentage system designed to indicate quality of work in
this class, is as follows:

+------------------+---------------+-----------------------------------+
| > **Work         | > **Letter    | > **Semester Grade Points (GPA)** |
| > Quality**      | > Grade**     |                                   |
+==================+===============+:=================================:+

## 

## Attendance and Tardiness

In keeping with the \"un-grading\" policy of the course (see below), we
will not take official attendance nor deduct points for missed classes
or late arrivals. The class will move quickly, however, so it\'s your
responsibility to check in with both of us should you miss any course
content or instruction. More than most other courses, what we study and
practice on a Monday will be essential for what we\'ll study on
Wednesday, etc. (imagine learning multiplication without knowing first
how to add). Missing class equals missing important steps in the
learning process. A pattern of absences may also affect the case you
build for your semester grade.

If for some reason you anticipate being absent, arriving late, or
leaving early during a class period, **please let us know beforehand**!

> (*Note:* We do not take attendance, but for the record: because it is
> considered an infringement on student privacy for faculty to have
> access to student medical records, faculty cannot accept medical
> documentation to justify absences. If you have a legitimate reason for
> your absence and want to provide verification, please access the
> Absence Documentation Form
> [here](https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?TexasChristianUniv&layout_id=8).)

**Excused Absences or Official University Absences** are absences
described in the Official University Absence Policy and include the
following: Title IX related issues, military leave, holy days, and
university related absences. As faculty we may not penalize students for
these absences and must allow for the completion of assignments and
exams within a reasonable amount of time after the absences. Beyond
these, faculty retain all discretion for consideration of a student's
absence, including absences verified by the Dean of Students' Office.

## Class Enrichment (i.e Participation and Engagement))

*We cannot emphasize this enough*: learning any new skill requires an
active engagement on the part of the learner. Therefore, class
participation is a critical component of the course. While some lecture
will be necessary to establish necessary contexts and to propose reading
strategies, most of the learning needs to come from lively discussion
and a certain degree of daring and play. Get involved early and often.
The class will surpass expectations if you do; it will be miserable if
you don't.

## Late Work

We don't like to allow late work because it can pile up quickly, and it
limits our ability as instructors to provide timely feedback. However,
we also don't deduct any points for late work. Please contact us before
the assignment is due if you would like an extension. We\'re typically
happy to give you one. **Understand, though, that a pattern of late or
unsubmitted work will compromise the case you build for your semester
grade.** Students who expect, for example, an A in the course should
receive "Exceeds Expectations" on the majority of the assignments and
have no late or missing assignments (unless arrangements are made for an
extension).

## Safe Zone

Our goal is for each student to feel comfortable and able to connect
with course content and classroom discussion. Please know that we
welcome, affirm, and celebrate persons in the LGBTQIA communities of
Texas Christian University. (LGBTQIA stands for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual,
Transgender, Queer, Intersex, Asexual, Ally). We will not allow
homophobic comments in class and will strive to use inclusive language.
Please visit <http://www.allies.tcu.edu/training.asp> for more
information.

## System Requirements

Throughout the semester, you will be doing a lot of coding in HTML, CSS,
and JavaScript. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have the
necessary hardware to do this. If you have any technical difficulties,
contact your professor or IT at least a week before the assignment is
due.

> **Computer:** You must have access to a reliable computer and internet
> connection to take this course, a machine that meets the TCU Online
> minimum requirements.
>
> **TCU Online** is required for this class.
>
> **Virtual Studio Code** is the free tool we'll use to write and edit
> our code for class.
>
> **Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI)** technology (Google Gemini,
> ChatGPT, etc.) is permitted---and encouraged---for your use in this
> class provided that you **document**, in detail, any and all uses of
> the technology through **descriptive notes (# comments)**.
>
> *Note:* The inappropriate or unauthorized use of AI-generated content
> may be academic misconduct and/or a violation of discipline-specific
> professional ethics. Such misuse will be handled according to TCU's
> Academic Conduct Policy or other relevant policies and may result in
> sanctions, including failing the course, program dismissal,
> suspension, or expulsion.
>
> **Email:** *Only* the official TCU student email address will be used
> for all course notifications. It is your responsibility to check your
> TCU email on a regular basis: you should check it daily.

## Class Norms & Recordings

We consider our classroom a safe space for people to learn, and we have
an obligation to ensure it remains intact. All members of the class are
expected to follow rules of common courtesy in person and in all email
messages, discussions, or any exchanges on a digital platform related to
this class.

Our class sessions are not available for public consumption or
circulation beyond the intended uses for this class. Audio, video, or
screen recording (including screen shots, snips, grabs, etc.) is
prohibited and can result in a failing grade for this course and
suspension of access to University Computing Resources. TCU students are
prohibited from sharing any portion of course materials (including
videos, PowerPoint slides, assignments, or notes) with others, including
on social media, without written permission by the course instructors.
Be sure to read [the full TCU
policy](https://security.tcu.edu/polproc/).

Of course, if you have accommodations that allow you to make audio
recordings, however, please review [Student Access and
Accommodation](https://cte.tcu.edu/tcu-syllabus-policies/#access) and
contact me immediately. You can, of course, take good notes. If you
cannot attend a class for any reason, you're welcome to contact another
classmate to find out what you missed, and you can always set up a
one-on-one conference with me if you have questions about the material.

## Center for Digital Expression (Scharbauer 2003)

The CDEx is available to students working on new media and digital
humanities assignments. The staff is available to help you with your
projects. We will refer to the resource sections in the CDEx website
